![mgrundy's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=mgrundy&range=month)

Stats were cool, but don't include private repos you no longer have access to (no longer with org) or count Enterprise github stats (different userid now that I think about it). I work my ass off, have thousands of commits from the past 15 years and am not going to put up with a robot giving me a shitty grade.
